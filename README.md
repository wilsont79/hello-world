# hello-world
Getting going again with github!
I worked extensively with Github at Sunbelt Transformer a few years ago.
I am an IT manager that has a great deal of experince in IT with 20+ years.
I "grew up" in IT as a network, systems, and database engineer having 
helped companies with digital transformation to the latest/best-for-the-business 
technologies several times over the years.
I love to play and listen to many kinds of music and I love to work out. 
Most importantly, however, I love my wife and family... they are amazing!!
